<h3>Community guidelines</h3>

<pre>
Effective Date: 1 June 2025


1. Introduction

At Accezz, we are committed to fostering a welcoming, respectful, and inspiring environment for art collectors. Our community is built on shared values of creativity, inclusivity, and meaningful connections. These guidelines outline the expectations for member conduct, ensuring that Accezz remains a space where individuals can engage with art, exchange ideas, and build relationships in a positive and supportive atmosphere. By becoming a member, you agree to uphold these standards, contributing to a culture of respect, integrity, and artistic appreciation. Violations of these guidelines may result in membership suspension or termination.


2. Respect & Inclusivity

Accezz is a diverse community where members from different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives come together to celebrate art. We expect all members to treat one another with kindness and respect, fostering an environment free from discrimination, harassment, or exclusion. Members must engage in discussions and interactions with courtesy and professionalism. Hate speech, bullying, or any form of discriminatory behavior based on race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or any other characteristic will not be tolerated. Members should respect differing opinions and engage in constructive dialogue when discussing art, collecting, and industry-related topics.


3. Community Engagement & Conduct

Accezz is designed to be a space for meaningful connections and enriching conversations. Members are expected to contribute positively to the community and uphold the integrity of interactions. They should participate in discussions, events, and networking opportunities in a manner that aligns with Accezz’s mission. Any form of disruptive, aggressive, or inappropriate behavior—whether in person or online—may result in disciplinary action. Members must respect the privacy of others and refrain from sharing personal or contact details of fellow members without consent.


4. Event Etiquette & Participation

Accezz hosts exclusive events, exhibitions, and gatherings designed to enhance the art collecting experience. To ensure a seamless and enjoyable experience for all attendees, members must adhere to event guidelines. Members should RSVP responsibly and notify organizers if they are unable to attend an event they have registered for. Respect for event spaces, hosts, and fellow attendees is essential, and disruptive behavior will not be tolerated. Photography and content sharing at events should be done with discretion, ensuring that privacy and intellectual property rights are respected.


5. Intellectual Property & Content Sharing

Accezz values artistic integrity and respects intellectual property rights. Members must ensure that any content shared within the community aligns with ethical and legal standards. While members may share insights, artwork, and discussions, they must respect copyright laws and intellectual property rights. Unauthorized reproduction or distribution of proprietary content, including event materials, discussions, and branding, is strictly prohibited. If members share content featuring other individuals, they must obtain consent before posting or distributing such material.


6. Privacy & Confidentiality

Accezz is a private membership community, and we take privacy seriously. Members must respect the confidentiality of discussions, events, and personal interactions within the network. Personal information shared within Accezz should remain within the community and not be disclosed externally without consent. Members must not use Accezz’s platform or events for unsolicited promotions, commercial activities, or unauthorized networking. Any misuse of member data or violation of privacy policies may result in immediate membership termination.


7. Compliance & Ethical Standards

Accezz operates with integrity and expects members to uphold ethical standards in all interactions. Members must comply with all applicable laws and regulations when engaging in community activities. Fraudulent, deceptive, or unethical behavior—including misrepresentation of credentials, financial misconduct, or exploitation of the community—will not be tolerated. Members should report any violations of these guidelines to Accezz’s team to ensure a safe and respectful environment for all.


8. Violations & Consequences

Failure to adhere to these Community Guidelines may result in disciplinary action, including warnings, suspension, or termination of membership. Accezz reserves the right to review and address violations on a case-by-case basis.
