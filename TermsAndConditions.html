<h3>Terms and Conditions</h3>

<pre>
Effective Date: 1 June 2025


1. Introduction

By becoming a member, you agree to the following terms and conditions, which govern your participation and engagement with our vibrant community. At Accezz, we believe that art is more than just something to admire—it is something to own, to live with, and to pass down. Our mission is to inspire individuals to collect art, regardless of if they have already started or are just beginning to explore this world. We are cultivating a dynamic space where people who love art—whether seasoned collectors, emerging enthusiasts, or those simply intrigued by the idea—can connect, share, and grow together in their passion for engaging with art through collecting. While traditionally, the art world has been dominated by more seasoned collectors with the financial means, time, and resources to build collections, we aim to shift that narrative. Accezz is designed for a new generation—art lovers in their 20s and 30s—who seek to embrace the excitement of collecting, regardless of where they are in their journey. From already owning pieces or anticipating starting your collection in 10 or 20 years, our community is here to provide inspiration, insights, and opportunities to explore the world of art ownership in a way that feels approachable, enriching, and deeply personal. Through exclusive events, curated experiences, and meaningful connections with fellow collectors and industry experts, Accezz empowers its members to navigate the art world with confidence, fostering a culture of discovery and passion. We believe that collecting should not be reserved for the few—it should be an adventure available to all who appreciate the beauty, history, and significance of art. Joining Accezz means embarking on this journey with like-minded individuals who recognize that collecting isn’t just about acquiring objects—it’s about investing in stories, perspectives, and cultural legacies that shape the future. Together, we will redefine what it means to be an art collector in 2025 and beyond.
