We may disclose personal data to trusted service providers, including payment processors, event organizers, and technical support teams, to ensure the smooth processing of transactions, coordination of exclusive events, and maintenance of technical systems that support our platform. Additionally, Accezz may be required to share data with legal authorities if mandated by law or when necessary to safeguard the rights, security, and integrity of the community. In certain cases, partner organizations involved in collaborative events or initiatives may receive limited member information, but only with prior consent from the individuals concerned.
